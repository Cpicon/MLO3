# Getting Started

In this module we are going to walk through using the Reddit API, wrangling data, and then using HuggingFace model(s) to run inference on said data. The notebook for this week is broken up into those three parts.

Please use `reddit_and_huggingface.ipynb` and go through the prompts depending on which section you are on. If you get stuck, feel free to look at `reddit_and_huggingface_answer_key.ipynb` for the way we would solve these problems.

## Install packages by running:
```
cd code_student/Week_2
pip install transformers praw torch torchvision torchaudio
```
